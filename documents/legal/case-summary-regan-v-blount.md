Regan v. Blount, 1999 UT App 154
This case addressed the enforceability of oral employment contracts. The central issue was whether an employer could enforce a one-year oral employment agreement against an employee who terminated her employment after approximately five months.

The employer argued that in exchange for the employee's commitment to work for a full year, he had provided valid consideration in the form of a requested schedule, a specific number of hours, and a higher rate of pay than would have been offered otherwise.

The case explored the legal principle that while oral employment contracts are generally presumed to be "at-will," this presumption can be overcome by evidence of an agreement for a specific term. This matter highlights the critical power dynamics within employment law and contributes to the body of law governing workplace fairness.
