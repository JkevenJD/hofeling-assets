Professional Narrative: J. Keven Hofeling, Esq.
My career is a story of strategic evolution, built on the foundation of a 23-year legal practice and culminating in a forward-looking pivot to the intersection of law and technology. After retiring from a distinguished career as a solo practitioner focusing on family law, criminal defense, and consumer protection, I have dedicated myself to mastering the emerging, high-demand fields of Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence.  Â  

This transition was driven by a clear-eyed analysis of a legal market being fundamentally reshaped by technology. It is a proactive response designed to leverage my deep expertise in legal analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance to address the complex challenges of the digital age.

My journey is guided by a bespoke, multi-year curriculum of advanced, industry-leading certifications. This path is designed to build a unique and powerful skill set that bridges the critical gap between complex technology and the legal frameworks that govern it. This positions me to offer high-value consulting in specialized niches like AI Governance, Cybersecurity Compliance, and Legal-Tech Implementation.
