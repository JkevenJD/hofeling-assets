Visuals and background information for jkhofelinglaw.org website.
This repository houses the complete digital assets for the professional website of J. Keven Hofeling, Esq. The site chronicles a compelling professional evolution: the strategic pivot of a retired attorney, leveraging a 23-year career in law  to address the emerging, high-demand fields of Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence.   

The central theme is the fusion of two disciplines—the analytical rigor of law and the innovative potential of technology. This creates a unique and powerful value proposition for specialized consulting in areas such as AI Governance, Cybersecurity Compliance, and Legal-Tech Implementation , strategically positioned within Utah's nation-leading technology sector.   

Beyond a professional portfolio, the website serves as a platform for thought leadership and honors the legacy of the mentors—Steven Lee Payton, Tom Hofeling, and Blaine Hofeling—who were instrumental in shaping a career grounded in integrity and excellence. These assets provide the foundation for a digital presence that is both a testament to a distinguished past and a clear vision for the future.
